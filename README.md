## Description

Ideas to aid in monetizing your game to the maximum without detouring your 
consumers. 

## Motivation

Novice here. No real experience with game development, mostly just a gamer. My
goal here is to come up with good ideas to:

1. Keep money in my pocket (weird since money is for spending).
2. Show the game makers proper appreciation for the work they do by providing
   them with funds to continue their work for the full-life of maintaining that
   work (for the mainstream or other).
3. Share any good ideas (by sharing them all) to hopefully providing agreeable
   ethics/principles around long term funding support for games that game
   makers and gamers can agree on.
   
   I feel that as a gamer I've taken for granted the fact that I can pay 30-90
   dollars for a game and play for years online (for the price of my internet
   and electricity). That the games I'm used to playing on a server for years
   (for free) cost money to maintain. As an American, I want to play for as
   long and as free as possible any game that I so drop a dime on. But
   seriously, I always wondered how did Diablo 3 make any money without the
   auction house or RMT!? 
   
   I also hope I can come up with ideas that capitalist vultures can use to
   feed their greed for el denero and provide me with quality games (no 
   mobile, just mobile integration with Desktop/console).
4. Try and put a stop to the current game civil-war/depression (at least that
   is what the current state of gaming feels like to me).
